TheGoodDocsProject* exists because every project deserves good docs, and we believe that templates make good docs. 

At Write The Docs meetups and conferences, developers frequently ask where to get started, or what kind of documentation to produce for a new project. 

We want to unblock developers (and even technical writers) by providing the necessities for documenting open source software.

## Project outlines

A project outline is a list of the guidebooks you need to create when you document your project -- it's really a list of templates that you can use. The list is different depending on what type of software you're documenting, because a RESTful API, for example, has different documentation requirements from desktop software or a browser-based app.

As an example, suppose you have built a new RESTful API service. You could create reference documentation using Swagger and pat yourself on the back. But you could go further and complete the Minimum Viable Docset for a REST API: 

* Overview
* Quickstart
* Reference 

The **reference** section would of course explain what every endpoint in your API does. 
The **quickstart** would tell your users how to combine the services available in your endpoint to accomplish the task they came to do; it usually describes the steps in the simplest way they can be done, and users go on later to learn more advanced processes. The benefit is that anyone using your site for the first time -- or deciding whether to use it -- can see how it works and get successful results quickly. You will surely add more workflows later to help your users accomplish new tasks, but this is a good start. 
The **overview** provides vital information about what your API can and can't do, who it was designed for, and how it works. A large share of potential users won't even consider an API or framework without this information, because they want to be assured that it will work for them before they invest the time.

To create each of these guides (the Reference, Quickstart, and Overview), you can use our templates. 

Project outlines are based on the idea of a Minimum Viable Docset. 

Here are our criteria for a Minimum Viable Docset: 

* It's limited enough that a small team can get it done, even if the team consists of the developers who built the product.
* It focuses on eliminating the most common problems that new users of a certain type of documentation would have. For desktop apps, installation can be a big deal. For APIs, it's explaining the workflows they should use to get a task done. (Because people who use APIs usually need to use several endpoints in a certain order to complete a task.) 
* It contains enough information so that new users can stick with it and become advanced users, with the help of the documentation.

Using the Minimum Viable Docset for your product has the following benefits.

* It prevents potential users from walking away from the software simply because it lacks documentation or looks complicated.
* It prevents first-time users from giving up in the belief that the software is too hard to use. (When in fact, maybe they don't understand it yet and haven't been given the chance to.)
* It accelerates the learning curve and therefore the adoption process of your software. 

Project outlines are based on the Minimum Viable Docset, but they also provide guidance about how to improve your documentation as your software grows and matures. 

One of our goals is to work out the MVDs applicable to most (or all) of the kinds of software that need to be documented.

## Templates

Templates explain how to create each type of guidebook. 

A template is usually a list of questions for you to answer. You can think of them as prompts to make sure that the documentation includes most everything that your users will eventually look for. 

For example, if you were writing an overview for your API, you might need to answer the following questions (among others): 

* What problem is it supposed to solve, and for whom?
* What exact capabilities are available to the user? What services does it offer?
* What does it NOT do that developers should know about?

We're collecting templates from Silicon Valley companies or asking technical writers to create them. When you use the templates here, you benefit from the experience of numerous writers who have already thought about the problems you're trying to solve. 

The result is that you can make better documentation than before, in less time.

## Best practices 

Best practices are tips about writing and document design that will help you produce documentation that works. Some of them may already exist in numerous other places. We hope to create a short, easy-to-read guide that will help you to create better documentation with the least amount of time and effort.
